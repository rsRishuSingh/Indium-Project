ITEM 1.
BUSINESS
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping
people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through
eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric
experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our
customers. Each week, we serve approximately 270 million customers who visit more than 10,750 stores and numerous
eCommerce websites in 19 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital,
and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which
has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading
on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at
everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our
customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our
commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. Our fiscal year ends
on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-
month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025"),
January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") and January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"). During fiscal 2025, we generated total revenues of $681.0
billion, which primarily comprised net sales of $674.5 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in
Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders'
business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We completed our
initial public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we
opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint
venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2025, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 18 countries.
In 1996, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce
presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store service, enabling
customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and delivery
locations globally. In 2018, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through acquisitions with our majority stakes in
Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which enables us to
leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand our assortment and service offerings.
We are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites and service offerings, as
well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2025, to better serve our customers.
Together, these elements produce a global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as their primary retail
destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel
shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our business is expanding through
offerings such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, and financial services. These offerings represent mutually
reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking
convenience.
Information About Our Segments
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S.,
Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments:
Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S., which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the
Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's
net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations
in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 12
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

•
Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli and bakery,
frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies,
household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
•
General merchandise includes:

Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books);
◦
Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦
Fashion (e.g., apparel for adults and children, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
◦
Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed and bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings,
home decor, fabrics and crafts).
•
Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, and optical services.
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When
revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of
merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: "Allswell," "Athletic Works," "bettergoods," "Equate," "Free
Assembly," "Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "No
Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop," "Spring Valley," "Time and Tru," "Way to
Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include:
"Avia," "Better Homes & Gardens," "Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara," and "The Pioneer Woman."
Other offerings in the Walmart U.S. business include in-house advertising for brands and online marketplace sellers, supply chain
and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers, and data analytics and insights for merchants and suppliers. Additional
offerings include fuel, financial services and related products such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check
cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment lending.
Distribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located
strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped
through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General
merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract
with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by
customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver
directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.

Walmart International Segment
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart
International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as
well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist
of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and
cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca,
flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of
our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Walmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of
customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to
provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise
innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the
portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen
our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:
•
Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations
in certain countries in Africa.
•
Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in
December 2022.
•
Sold our equity investment in JD.com in August 2024.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail
stores and eCommerce, such as through our pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, including same-day delivery. We
continue to expand our marketplace offerings, which also further unlocks fulfillment and advertising services.
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas
generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2025, Walmart International had
approximately 2,900 pickup and delivery locations.
Merchandise and Other Offerings. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in
the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority
of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with
high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value,"
"Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific
brands including "Aurrera" and "Lider." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and
local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising,
marketplace and fulfillment services, financial services and healthcare. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer
prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile
and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In
Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service enhancing customer experiences through digital connectivity.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 184 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and
Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the
Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these
distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets
in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment
centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.

Sam's Club U.S. Segment
Sam's Club U.S. is a membership-only club that operates 600 clubs in 44 states in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and also operates
samsclub.com. Sam's Club U.S. had net sales of $90.2 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 2025 net
sales, and had net sales of $86.2 billion and $84.3 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a membership-only club,
membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
Plus Membership
Club Membership
Annual Membership Fee
$110
$50
Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each)
Up to 16

orders of $50 or greater. Plus members receive free curbside pickup, free delivery-from-club and free shipping on orders of $50 or
greater, exclusive discounts and convenience offers, and the ability to shop before regular shopping hours. Beginning in fiscal
2023, Sam's Club U.S. launched a rewards program through which members may earn Sam's Cash on purchases that can be
redeemed for cash, used for purchases, or used to pay membership fees.
Omni-channel. Sam's Club U.S. provides a fast and seamless omni-channel experience to members, integrating physical clubs and
eCommerce. Curbside pickup provides fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members; Scan & Go mobile checkout and
payment solution allows members to bypass the checkout line; and Just Go, launched in fiscal 2025, provides members with a
friction-free exit experience. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 94,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average
size of approximately 134,000 square feet.
Merchandise. Sam's Club U.S. offers merchandise in the following four merchandise categories:
•
Grocery consists of dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic
beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, paper
goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;
•
General merchandise includes home, hardlines and seasonal items (such as home improvement, outdoor living, gardening,
furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys and mattresses), as well as technology and
entertainment items (such as consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances and
third-party gift cards);
•
Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services, over-the-counter drugs; and protein and nutrition;
and
•
Fuel and other categories.
Within the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value.
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When
revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Distribution. Sam's Club U.S. utilizes 31 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some
of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club U.S. segment for certain items. Sam's Club U.S.
uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable merchandise
from distribution facilities to clubs. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Sam's Club U.S.'s non-fuel club purchases were shipped
from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club U.S. locations by suppliers. Sam's
Club U.S. ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile applications by a number of methods including
shipments made directly from clubs, 14 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.

Other Information
Competition. We compete with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail
and wholesale grocery, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, and supercenter-type stores, membership-only
warehouse clubs, gasoline stations, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising,
fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. Our ability to develop and effectively operate different
formats at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive
position in the retail industry within the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly
evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of
our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers and greater brand recognition. They may be able to
obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these
businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to
innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability,
services offered to customers, the quality of the products and services we offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the
shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost
and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-
channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive
pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:
•
EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices
will not change under frequent promotional activity;
•
EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our
customers;
•
Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the
ways they want to be served; and
•
Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, marketplace and
fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet
expanding needs.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent and varies by country due to different national and
religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume for each
segment has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
Suppliers and Supply Chain. As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S.
and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances,
we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly
products in the "fresh" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell
significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and
cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers.
Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker
safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to
offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products
to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example),
in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers
and members.
Intellectual Property. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets,
proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers
and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements
to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain
names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering
certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our
proprietary rights to third parties.
Government Regulation. As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among
jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax,
Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks."

Our Shared Value Priorities
We seek to operate our business in a way that creates shared value: We believe we maximize long-term value and create
competitive advantage for the Company by delivering for our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders,
suppliers, business partners and communities. We believe that addressing their needs builds the value of our business, including by
enhancing trust, creating new business opportunities, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage and
strengthening the underlying systems on which we rely.
We prioritize issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create long-term shared value: Issues that rank high in relevance
to our business, importance to building and maintaining stakeholder trust and in which Walmart has the ability to be an effective
actor. Our current priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community and ethics and integrity.
•
Opportunity. We believe that promoting economic opportunity helps Walmart attract and retain the talent we need to run
our business, respond to customer needs, and promote economic resilience in the places where we operate. Our approach
includes creating opportunities for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section
below), our suppliers, workers in supply chains and the communities we serve. We offer good entry-level jobs in addition
to multiple career pathways; endeavor to cultivate a culture of belonging—rooted in respect for the individual—where
associates and customers feel seen, supported and connected; and provide tens of thousands of local, national and global
suppliers the opportunity to grow with us.
•
Sustainability. Walmart's sustainability efforts endeavor to create and preserve long-term business value through
increasing the efficiency and resilience of our operations, promoting surety of supply, sourcing responsibly and enhancing
our product assortment. With respect to people, we aim to respect the dignity of people throughout our supply chain,
create economic opportunity for people working in supply chains, and sell safer, healthier products. With respect to the
environment, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains; preserve, protect, and restore nature;
reduce waste; procure renewable sources of energy; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
•
Community. We believe that Walmart thrives in strong, resilient communities, and we endeavor to help communities
thrive. We aim to strengthen communities by providing convenient access to affordable, quality goods and services
through our omni-channel retail model and everyday low prices; contributing to the economic vitality of communities by
providing quality jobs, training and career paths; investing in local suppliers; and supporting organizations and causes that
matter to our customers and associates.
•
Ethics and Integrity. We believe that people want to work for and do business with a company they can trust, and
Walmart works to create a culture that inspires trust with our stakeholders. We seek to achieve this, by focusing on
promoting ethics and compliance, governance and oversight, responsibly engaging in public policy activities, using data
and technology responsibly and respecting human rights.
We periodically publish information on our shared value priorities, strategies, progress, and challenges on the environmental, social
and governance ("ESG") reporting section of our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing
on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the SEC.
Human Capital Management
Our associates – powered by technology – play a critical role in delivering on our purpose to help people save money and live
better. Our business is focused on serving people and this is delivered by our approximately 2.1 million associates around the world
with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates internationally. In the U.S.,
approximately 92% of our associates are hourly and approximately 68% of our associates are full-time.
We believe our people make the difference, and we are focused on investing in the growth and well-being of our associates,
investing in digital experiences to improve their quality of work and creating a culture of belonging. An important part of our focus
is to provide opportunities for associates to grow and learn. For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills
that are relevant for a variety of careers. We are focused on developing, rewarding and retaining associates in an ever-changing
environment. Our people ultimately make Walmart a better place to work and a better place to shop. Our workforce strategy
includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.
Belonging - Focus on creating a workplace where all associates feel seen, supported and connected through a culture of
belonging. We publish our workforce representation and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring belonging updates to
senior leadership – including our President and CEO – and members of the Board of Directors. Of the approximately 2.1 million
associates employed worldwide, 51% are women. In the U.S., 51% of the approximately 1.6 million associates are people of color.

--- Page 13 ---
Our Belonging focus aims to create opportunities for everyone, so that every eligible and qualified individual can thrive and
perform. We regularly review our processes around fair-pay practices and are committed to creating a performance culture where
associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance and the work they do.
To build a company where associates feel seen, supported and connected, we gather and respond to associate feedback in a variety
of ways, including in-person dialogue; leadership visits and listening sessions; surveys like our associate engagement survey and
monthly pulse surveys; and always-on confidential channels, including our Open Door processes and ethics channels.
Well-being - Prioritize the emotional, physical and financial well-being of associates. We invest in our associates by offering
competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits to meet the diverse needs of our global associate population and their
eligible dependents. In the U.S., this includes company-paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building benefits, maternity
leave, fertility benefits, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan
match, life insurance, medical coverage (including supporting associates with a U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits for
medical doctor urgent care), behavioral and mental health services (including virtual care with psychiatrists and psychologists), a
Walmart discount card or Sam's Club membership and predictable scheduling that helps associates plan for life outside of work and
know what to expect in their paychecks.
Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in the
Our People brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including
our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-
K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the SEC. Certain information relating to retirement-related
benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new
skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates – in support of our business and their success – by offering good entry-level
jobs in addition to multiple career pathways that lead to great careers and better lives.
Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our
focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits and career
mobility creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce. In the U.S., we seek to enable these pathways
through programs like Walmart Academy, Live Better U ("LBU"), and other various associate training programs. Walmart
Academy offers training for on-the-job retail skills, leadership and well-being, serving our associates through a combination of
digital and in-person offerings. Additionally, our LBU program provides access to educational opportunities for our eligible part-
time and full-time associates in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, allowing associates the opportunity to learn critical skills in order to
promote into in-demand jobs within the company through high school diplomas, short-form certificates and credentials or college
degrees.
Digital - Drive a digital transformation that improves the associate experience and powers the business. To deliver a seamless
customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in consumer-grade digital tools designed to improve associate
productivity, efficiency, engagement, and performance — and these capabilities have been expanded to some international markets.
This allows associates to share real-time feedback and spend more time generating new ideas, developing strategy, and building
relationships.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors
that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face.
Strategic Risks
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology
may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve with consumers embracing the digital shopping experience and expecting a robust
online marketplace of goods available for purchase and delivery. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with
retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to
accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, including the use of artificial intelligence ("AI") and
generative AI technologies (which continues to grow and evolve within our Company), talent, supply chain automation and
enhancements, advertising, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or
effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market
position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings and
sustain the current pace of remodels. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building
and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and
maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise
strategy.
The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With the interconnected components of
this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or
member perceptions about our reputation in general, or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this
strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance, which could also result in impairment
charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including
increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn,
reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales
within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent and automation, including any operating losses
incurred for those initiatives, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of
these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our
reputation, relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth
of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their
shopping patterns, tastes and preferences. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer
demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive
environment. Our business is dependent on our ability to make critical decisions and predictions with respect to merchandise
categories that quickly respond to changing consumer spending patterns, tastes and preferences, and any incorrect calculations by
us may result in lower sales, spoilage and inventory markdowns, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our
ability to predict and adapt to changing tastes and preferences depends on many factors, including obtaining accurate and relevant
data on customer preferences, emphasizing relevant merchandise categories, effectively managing our inventory levels, and
implementing competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer
experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase
in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to
consumers for purchasing products. We must continue to preserve our reputation, which is impacted by public perceptions and
customer experiences. It may be difficult to address negative publicity across media channels, regardless of whether it is accurate.
Negative incidents, including the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft, misuse of AI technologies or a data breach as a
result of a cyberattack could quickly erode trust and confidence in our business and could result in consumer boycotts, workforce
unrest and government investigations. These incidents may involve us, our vendors that handle our data or personal information,
our workforce or others with whom we do business, including third-party service providers and independent contractors. Societal
expectations, preferences, trends and political expression are ever-changing and we try to adapt, evolve and maintain a balance that
meets the acceptance of our customers, members, associates, shareholders, suppliers and other stakeholders, but we may not always
move as quickly or in the direction that various competing interests desire or demand, which could impact our reputation. For
instance, strong opinions continue to be publicly expressed both for

and against diversity, equity and inclusion and ESG initiatives and positions taken by many corporations, including Walmart, are
tracked, monitored and subject to heightened scrutiny from consumers, investors, advocacy groups and public figures, potentially
leading to consumer boycotts, negative publicity campaigns, litigation and reputational harm. Negative reputational incidents or
negative perceptions of us could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through lower sales, the
termination of business relationships and negative impacts to associate retention and recruiting efforts. Moreover, failure to
adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and
fulfillment centers could result in excess or insufficient inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could
significantly harm our business. As we continue to add new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology networks become
increasingly complex and operating them in a way that effectively meets consumer demands continues to be challenging. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and other businesses
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects
of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social
commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital
advertising, data analytics/insights, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel
retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase
competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better
able to innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability,
services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience
we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, quality and accessibility of data for customers, suppliers, and
associates, and cost, speed of and options for accurate delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital
platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-
channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy
could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of the
competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to
bankruptcy, economics or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel
ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with improved financial resources, improved access to
merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or
alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could
adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect
our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline and
diesel fuel, increased costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of
essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in GDP and consumer disposable
income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns,
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in
healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of export and import restrictions, tariffs, trade barriers or other measures
that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other
economic factors in the U.S., or in any of the other markets in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer demand for the
products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to any one or more markets
with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales, growth
rates, operating income and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially
adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other
long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation,
labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other
countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and
otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an
increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing

goods in the volume typically available to us for sale, or adversely impact product margins due to higher labor and material costs of
our suppliers that we are unable, or choose not, to pass on to our customers.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in
other markets to expand our business. These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech venture) may not generate the level of sales
or profitability we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive
position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in
connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our divested markets, could materially adversely affect
our financial performance.
Operational Risks
Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of
operations.
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics, epidemics or other health crises are uncertain
and difficult to predict. A pandemic, epidemic or contagious disease outbreak that affects humans or the food supply, such as the
avian flu impact on poultry and egg production could impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-
stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to
contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, limitations
on large gatherings, business and government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future
performance, exposure to litigation and our financial performance, among other things. In the event of any global or regional health
crisis, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate, customer behaviors may change and consumer disposable income
could be negatively impacted, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand.
These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our
financial performance.
To the extent that a future pandemic, epidemic or contagious disease outbreak occurs, such events may also heighten other risks
described in this Item 1A, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our
reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption,
supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, and litigation and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, catastrophic and other events could materially adversely affect our
financial performance.
Natural disasters, weather conditions, geopolitical tensions and other catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our
operations and financial performance. These may include extreme weather-related events such as hurricanes, tropical storms,
typhoons, floods, wildfires, cyclones, tornadoes, winter storms, droughts, and extreme temperatures, any of which may be
exacerbated by a changing climate, as well as other natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. Moreover, geopolitical
tensions or events; and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest (including theft, looting or vandalism), terrorist
attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), or the loss
of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located or regions goods
are transported from or through, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine and Israel, armed hostilities in the Red Sea and
surrounding areas through which ocean carrier vessels travel to the Suez Canal and delays that have occurred traversing the
Panama Canal resulting from drought) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Protecting the safety of our
associates, including our senior leaders, is critical to preventing business disruption and executing on our business strategies and
objectives.
Any of the events described above could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the
closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of
an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs
affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment
centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers
(including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings,
travel and movement limitations or otherwise), temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers or
disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are
operating and could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. In fiscal 2025, Hurricanes Helene and Milton
impacted our stores, operations and supply chains in the Southeastern U.S., although such events did not materially impact our
consolidated financial performance. Moreover, these disasters and events can negatively impact consumers' disposable income, the
temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from
overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in
which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our

stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability or economic sanctions, increased
transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical
infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities and the
disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions,
drought or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) may be widespread and are
unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at
stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain
commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; disruption of electrical grids or
utilities required to operate our stores, clubs and information systems; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term
disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may
include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events
affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our
engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or
fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their
impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial
performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance.
Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely
affect our financial and operational performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the
products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws,
including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct.
Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the
large volumes we may demand, are significant challenges, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside
the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as we previously experienced (and
could experience again) with the pandemic recovery related challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor
shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located or regions goods
are transported from or through, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill
their indemnification obligations to us if called upon, thereby exposing us to the full cost of risks and claims, suppliers' failure to
meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced
by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, extreme weather events impacting the
growing, manufacturing, mining and harvesting of commodities and products, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or
delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs and other facilities, including
as a result of extreme weather or labor slowdowns and/or strikes at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we
purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security,
inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of
goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain
types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond
our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers, our access to products and our access to service providers (such as
transportation and logistics providers) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products we sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory
standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a
material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.
Our customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally, the quality of products that
we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In many cases, these products are subject to regulatory action or
recall. For general merchandise, this could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it could be
because the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because the product does not
produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these factors could cause customers to avoid
purchasing certain products from us or to choose to buy products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is outside of our
control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. When a

--- Page 22 ---
product we sell does not meet quality or safety standards, there is an increased risk of liability for harm the product may cause our
customers. While we rely on our suppliers to meet our safety and quality expectations, and to indemnify us if their products do not,
certain suppliers may not have the financial capacity or ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. In that case, we may be
exposed to the full cost of liability claims. Any issue regarding the quality or safety of products we sell, regardless of the cause,
could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products offered for sale on our third-party marketplace fails to meet our customers' expectations
or regulatory standards, we could be held directly liable, lose customers, become subject to regulatory enforcement or
otherwise experience reputational harm.
Some of the products customers buy from our website are sold by third parties, which we refer to as marketplace transactions.
While that transaction ultimately occurs between the third-party seller and the customer, some regulators and courts have taken a
view that the retailer is responsible for marketplace transactions that occur on a retailer's digital platform. Unsettled law on whether
a retailer is responsible for intellectual property or product liability claims related to marketplace transactions creates additional
risk. Any unfavorable changes or legal interpretations could further expose us to liability. Our arrangements with our third-party
marketplace sellers are complex and we may not be able to implement, maintain and develop the components of these commercial
relationships, which may include fulfillment, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, content and engaging
other third parties to perform services.
In addition, poor quality or safety of third-party products offered for sale on our platforms could erode customer trust, leading to
loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational,
financial and other risks, including liability for third-party products offered for sale on our platform that are controversial,
counterfeit, pirated or stolen or that infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We may not be able to collect sufficient
damages for these types of breaches from third-party sellers. Furthermore, even if we are successful in negotiating a contractual
shift in risk of loss to third parties, a regulator may view us as having responsibility for regulatory compliance of the third-party
products offered for sale on our platform. Although we have marketplace compliance controls in place and impose contractual
terms on sellers to prohibit sales of non-compliant products, we may not be able prevent sellers from offering prohibited items for
sale, enforce such terms or fully protect against regulatory risk. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy.
We rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our
business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our
business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages,
computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-
service attacks, security incidents and breaches from a variety of threat actors, including both cybercriminals and nation state-
sponsored actors, catastrophic events such as wildfires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes,
utility outages, usage errors by our associates or contractors and civil or political unrest or armed hostilities. The availability of our
information systems and the integrity of data are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions,
management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information
systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged,
breached, attacked, interrupted or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or
replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim.
Any interruption to the availability of our information systems or corruption of our data may have a material adverse effect on our
business or results of operations. In addition, the cost of securing our systems against failure or attack is considerable, and increases
in these costs, particularly in the wake of a breach or failure, could be significant.
In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems. The risk of system
disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and update our
information systems and processes, system disruptions may occur and we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational
benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
could be negatively impacted.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver products
and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business
globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do
comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance
their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs
including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local
Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel

retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to make
investments in supply chain automation and enhancements to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our
customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations
through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment.
We continue to invest in AI and generative AI technologies to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and our associate work
experience and to improve efficiencies of our supply chain, operations, management functions and talent recruitment and
development; however, these are evolving technologies and there are inherent operational and legal complexities associated with
implementation of these technologies within our business. When integrating and introducing AI and generative AI technologies into
our platforms, processes and systems, we may be exposed to new or expanded liabilities and risks due to elevated governmental
scrutiny and monitoring, litigation, data privacy risks and compliance issues in a disparate and at times conflicting regulatory
environment, all of which could negatively affect our financial performance and business reputation.
Some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by an increasing number of
third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as
anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology, faulty implementation or a cybersecurity incident, such failure
can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to
provide attractive, user-friendly and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at
competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online
shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could
place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a
material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business
and results of operations.
Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates,
business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage
our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur
substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
Like most retailers, we process in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers
and members, and we also process information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness
business operations and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf store and maintain protected health
information. Further, we recently acquired VIZIO Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries, which collects certain consumer data,
including certain television viewing data. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and
technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party service providers for a variety of
reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, compute capacity, medical record documentation, content
delivery to customers and members, back-office support and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we
hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for disrupting or obtaining access to information systems or
information stored in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases, they
may lead to successful attacks. Unauthorized activities directed against information systems and devices, whether our own or those
of our third-party service providers and vendors, have resulted in cybersecurity incidents, including malware, ransomware, denial
of service attacks or phishing incidents. We expect that our information systems and those of our third-party service providers,
vendors and suppliers will continue to experience such attacks in the future, which could include disruptions to our supply chain
system. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular nation-states, or be the work of sophisticated criminal
organizations, insiders (including our associates or contractors) or third parties, each with a wide-range of motives and expertise.
We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience incidents and threats to data and
information systems. These incidents and threats have included and are likely to continue to include both random and targeted
cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and
attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and
disruptions. The use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces to be exploited.
Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting
our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. As noted above, some of our information systems and
those of our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents or breaches, including during fiscal 2025, and,
although to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results or business, there can be no assurance of a
similar result in the future.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the
systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in legacy operations and acquired eCommerce,
technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to impede the operations of

our system or gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce
applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including personal information and/or payment information,
and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, may result in potential data and personal information misuse
and/or loss and may create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage the information systems that enable or
support one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience,
our supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the
security of the information systems that enable or support our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable
parameters, we could be subject to regulatory fines, suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and
deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or
confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password and identity management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and
irregularities may also result in a defeat of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and a compromise or
breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications that comprise our information system
and networked environment may have vulnerabilities or defects of design, coding, manufacture or operations that could be
intentionally exploited or inadvertently used in a manner that could compromise information security. Given the age, size and
complexity of these information systems and our networked environment, patches for certain vulnerabilities may not exist and,
even where patches or other risk-mitigating activities are available, the deployment of patches or execution of risk-mitigating
actions may not occur before an underlying vulnerability is exploited by threat actors or inadvertently results in the compromise of
our information systems or data.
Any compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in regulated data or
confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons
could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009, collectively known as "HIPAA" and with respect to personal information, liability under international and state data breach
notification laws), customer attrition, remediation expenses and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial
institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations,
reputation, financial position and results of operations.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems or data change
frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement
adequate preventative measures, or detect the activities of a threat actor. Moreover, the increasing sophistication of AI technologies
poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit AI to create convincing false identities or manipulate
verification processes. Even if we detect a fraudulent or cybersecurity incident, the nature and extent of that incident may not be
immediately clear. Based on the sophistication of the threat actors and the size and complexity of our information systems and
networked environment, among other factors, an investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time
to complete. We may not understand or appreciate that what is detected and treated as multiple individual cybersecurity incidents or
events may be associated with the coordinated actions of a single threat actor or group. In addition, while our investigation of a
cybersecurity incident is ongoing, we may not know the full extent of the harm caused by a threat actor, and such harm may spread
both internally and to certain customers, vendors or other third parties. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid,
complete and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident to customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the
public. It may also not be clear how best to contain and remediate any harm caused by the cybersecurity incident, and certain errors
or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further
increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident on our business operations, financial position and results of
operations.
To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems
results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by
claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk.
Disruptions in our systems caused by associate error or malfeasance, security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including
attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks or utility companies) – could harm our
ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-
party service providers, customers, members, financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines traditional
retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, health and wellness and other customer and business

services into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be
widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and
shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a
material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores, thereby materially adversely affecting our
operations, net sales, growth rates, operating income, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events
could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and
performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities,
which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or operationally impactful malware event,
such as ransomware, could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and
to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential
information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a
disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer (EBT)
cards, mobile payments and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which
may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to
various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we or our third-party suppliers maintain are
able to detect, prevent or contain cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches or other compromises from malware,
ransomware or other threats that are known or may be developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with
payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require
us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in
connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be
substantial.
We also have compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention,
disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations,
breaches may trigger obligations under U.S. federal and state laws and laws in certain other countries to notify affected individuals,
government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity incidents that result in a data breach or our failure to comply with
such laws could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.
Changes in third-party reimbursements and contracts, type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business could
adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We have retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. segments across the U.S. and in various of our
international markets such as Canada and Mexico.
A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through
established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental
agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including:
reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our
pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement
terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which
otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network
arrangements, including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or
program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative
burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals
become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which
there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our
pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the
elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including
competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances
among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to
pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or
incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices
of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying
for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy
industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of health reform efforts and other changes to or novel interpretations
of existing state or federal laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy
operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such

pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy
customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.
One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell,
our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the
loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and
mix of services we provide and the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered. Any of these
developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor
issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing
number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill
positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while
controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability
of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those
markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised
employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including our
enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are
critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for example,
technology, health and wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates.
Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in
increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain
qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease
and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or novel interpretations of existing
labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented that
further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
Illegal or inappropriate activity of our independent contractors or third-party service providers could expose us to liability
and adversely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.
We are subject to risks related to our engagement of independent contractors or other third-party service providers. The
qualification processes and background checks we utilize when engaging independent contractors may not reveal all potentially
relevant information, including accurate worker authorization information and criminal history. If these independent contractors
engage in misconduct, consumers may not consider our goods and services safe, and we may receive negative press coverage.
Further, we have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud with respect to unauthorized
uses of another person's identity and use of fraudulent identification documents. Any physical injury, loss of life, fraud, property
and/or financial damage caused by our independent contractors or third-party service providers could adversely affect our business
reputation, which could negatively affect demand for our goods and services, lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure and
adversely affect our financial performance.
Financial Risks
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of
our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to
meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth rates,
eCommerce growth rates, advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which are expected to help drive our operating income
growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates or
earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or
stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations
by securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the
price of our stock.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results
of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated
Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of
the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S.
dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable
have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.

--- Page 29 ---
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also
result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial
performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be
without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely
affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our
reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency
other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such
products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase
and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a
corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely
affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic
risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our
business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,
India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart
International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in
these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include
political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as
regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce
and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures
or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating
to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering
laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign exchange or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data
protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.
Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be
expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice
and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state
governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future,
actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and
could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other
international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect
our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations
have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our
financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal
policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar
organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than
the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of
managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in
countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business
outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to
differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of
our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to
regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and
regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based
in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may
be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance
programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could
subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.

Changes in tax and trade laws, regulations and interpretations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
In fiscal 2025, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net
sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs, trade barriers, other restrictions on the exportation and
importation of goods and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of
the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant
portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions,
including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly
or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially
adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international operations as well as our business.
We are subject to income taxes, other taxes and tax collection and reporting obligations in both the U.S. and the foreign
jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income
taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our taxes could be materially adversely
affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes
in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles and the interpretations of those rules. In addition, we also
may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or
collection obligations by the effective date of those obligations.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative
interpretations of existing tax laws, and changes in transfer pricing arrangements with our subsidiaries, any of which can impact
our or our subsidiaries' current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law, changes in administrative
interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in transfer pricing arrangements could also have a material effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed
federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal
Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the
relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations,
including collecting information not regularly produced by us or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur
additional costs and could affect our results of operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to enforce
novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent
changes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European Union and other
countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax
principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15%
global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis, which became effective in many jurisdictions in which we operate
starting January 1, 2024. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax
rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the
prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations, legislation and interpretations. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated
Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for
which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to
the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position or
our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate and could be materially
adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new
legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and
media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere to our practices and procedures to comply with these laws
and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges. If we fail to prevent independent contractors or third-
party service providers from violating our policies or applicable laws or committing any fraudulent acts against us or our
customers, it could harm our business or damage our reputation, and we could face liability for unlawful activities by such third
parties.
Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but
not limited to, those related to: licensing; reimbursement arrangements and other requirements and restrictions; registration and
regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental
(including Medicare and Medicaid) and commercial reimbursement; data privacy and security and the sharing

and interoperability of data, including obligations and restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under
HIPAA); protection of consumer health data; billing and coding for healthcare services and properly handling overpayments; debt
collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients and other fraud
and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws and patient inducement regulations; qualification
of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and equipment; and the practice of the professions of
pharmacy and optometry.
Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain
aspects of our operations. For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and various other regulatory
authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are
required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and
various state-controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled
substances. The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers,
including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of
these laws and regulations. In addition, there has been recent heightened governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical
product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and
proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government program reimbursement
methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug
prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also
impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. States may enact conflicting laws, mandating changes
in operations that negatively impact our ability to execute uniformly and achieve economies of scale across states. We may not be
able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may have an adverse effect on our
business.
Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech venture, we offer various services such as money
transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards,
installment lending and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory
requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent fraud and other illicit activity, privacy, information security, anti-
money laundering and sanctions regimes and consumer protection under U.S. state and federal laws and regulations, as well as
those of certain other countries. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and
harm to our reputation. Increased U.S. regulation of non-bank financial institutions may also result in additional requirements and
scrutiny of certain financial services we offer.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations
related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, and
the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security requirements;
consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement and promotion of products we
sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs, as well as our ONE fintech
venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade and other sanctions matters;
licensure, including supply chain logistics licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs; cross border data
transfer; data privacy, cybersecurity and the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, workplace health and safety,
equal employment opportunity, worker classification, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and
wellness related regulations for our pharmacy and optometry operations. Failure to meet these requirements could affect the
profitability of our business activities; limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or conduct business in certain jurisdictions;
require changes to business practices or governance or alter our relationships with our customers, partners and other third parties,
including our ability to continue certain relationships in Mexico, India or other international jurisdictions; result in increased costs
related to regulatory oversight and compliance, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to customers or the
imposition of fines or monetary penalties.
Governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and
disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste
reduction, energy, human capital and risk oversight could change the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required
to control, assess and report.
Data privacy and protection laws or customer expectations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and
processing of personal information continue to undergo a rapid transformation in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Recently
enacted state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), in a number of states that have become effective, or
will soon be effective, have created a substantially more complex regulatory regime associated with data-handling practices.
Moreover, other laws and regulations related to data-handling and privacy that apply to our business, such as the Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United Kingdom's General Data
Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information Protection Act ("PIPL"), and
similar legislation in Quebec, Canada further increase the compliance obligations of our business. Certain of these laws have
required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and

expenses to comply, which we anticipate will continue in the future. These and other privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry
significant potential damages and civil penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of noncompliance with a material
provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to
levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover (i.e., revenue) in the prior year.
These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Further, PIPL took effect in
China in November 2021. PIPL raises the requirements for processing personal information and requires our China business to
undergo a cybersecurity assessment and obtain approval from the Cyberspace Administration of China ("CAC") as well as consent
from the personal information owner before personal information collected in China may be transferred to, or accessed from,
outside of China. Walmart obtained CAC approval in September 2023. Fines for PIPL violations range from approximately RMB
50 million to up to 5% of the infringing company's previous year's revenues generated from within China. We have made changes,
and we may in the future make additional adjustments to our business practices, to comply with the personal information protection
laws and regulations in China as they evolve. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws generally have rights to
access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and selling,
receive detailed information about how their personal information is used and may have a private right of action for data breaches.
Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act. We may be subject to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including being required to
change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could
result in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or
regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities for
existing antitrust, competition and pricing laws, use and disposal of plastics, recycled plastics or other packaging materials, ESG,
consumer protection and AI technology, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be predicted, and changes
in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of existing laws and
regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require
significant capital expenditures, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse
publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and
operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business, operations and financial performance may
be adversely affected.
We acquired VIZIO Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively "VIZIO") in December 2024. As part of its business, VIZIO
collects certain consumer data, including viewing data from its opted-in internet-connected televisions. In 2017, VIZIO stipulated
to the entry of a judgment in federal district court with the Federal Trade Commission and the New Jersey Attorney General to
settle alleged violations related to certain of its business practices (the "VIZIO Order"). The VIZIO Order remains in effect until
2037 and requires VIZIO to comply with specified obligations related to its collection and use of certain information collected from
a VIZIO internet-connected device. These requirements apply to certain VIZIO entities and all other persons in active concert or
participation with them. Our ownership of VIZIO and these compliance obligations are new, and if we fail to adequately design or
implement controls for these matters, we may face additional regulatory action, penalties or monetary fines, any of which could
have a substantial negative impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. The regulatory, political and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks. To the extent
a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued
operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required licenses and
certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers;
and significant fines or monetary damages. Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any
of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and have a
material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are or may be involved in legal proceedings, including litigation,
arbitration and other claims, investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax,
consumer protection, employment, environmental and other governmental authorities as well as private individuals. We may also
be involved in legal proceedings brought by regulatory authorities, organizations and individuals relating to product packaging,
including that such packaging is made of plastic, is not appropriately disposed, contains PFAS, or contains misrepresentations
about its recyclability, compostability, biodegradability or reusability. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal
commitments of certain business customers we contract with and businesses we have

divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative actions, class and representative actions and multi-district
litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions
and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain
unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class, representative or
collective action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal, state and local wage and hour and
employment laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims
under federal and state competition and consumer protection laws.
We have been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide
controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. We are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings
related to opioids, including the multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804)
currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, cases pending in various state and federal courts, and
a lawsuit filed against us by the U.S. Department of Justice in the District of Delaware in 2020. We cannot predict the ultimate
number of opioids-related claims that may be filed or their outcomes and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that
may arise from opioids-related matters.
In addition, we have been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities regarding
the independent contractor classification of drivers and payment and operational practices with respect to our driver platform, as
well as defending putative class and representative action civil litigation relating to driver classification and defending other civil
litigation and arbitration claims in connection with the driver platform. On December 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau ("CFPB") filed a lawsuit against the Company and Branch Messenger, Inc. in the District of Minnesota alleging the
Company violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by allegedly requiring independent contractor drivers on the Spark
platform to receive payments through a financial product offered by Branch. The CFPB seeks an injunction and unspecified
restitution, damages and civil penalties. On February 20, 2025, the Court entered an order that indefinitely stays the case and
vacates all deadlines. We cannot predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities or the civil litigation and
arbitration matters. We cannot provide any assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance that our
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its
subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and
directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct
Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period
from 2009 to 2015, prior to our acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018 (the "Notice"), in addition to more recent
requests for information from the Directorate of Enforcement to Flipkart for periods prior and subsequent to April 2016 regarding
the Rules, including the most recent request in February 2025 (the "Requests"). The Notice is an initial stage of proceedings under
the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the
allegations described in the Notice. If a hearing is initiated, whether with respect to the Notice or from further proceedings related
to the Requests, and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, then the regulatory authority has the authority to
impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief, such as share ownership restrictions. We are unable to predict whether the Notice will
lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings, as well as whether any further
proceedings will arise with respect to the Requests. We cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from
these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the Notice or the
Requests and further can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be
materially adversely affected.
On January 13, 2020, the Competition Commission of India ("CCI") ordered its Director General (the "DG") to investigate certain
matters alleging competition law violations by certain subsidiaries of Flipkart in India and other parties. On September 13, 2024,
those subsidiaries received a non-confidential version of the DG's Investigation Report (the "Report"), alleging certain competition
law violations. CCI is not bound by the Report, and will conduct its independent analysis of the allegations, including hearing
objections from the subsidiaries and other parties before issuing its final order in the matter, which could include monetary and
non-monetary relief. CCI's final order would also be subject to appropriate appellate proceedings. We can provide no assurance as
to the scope and outcome of this matter, cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise, and can provide no
assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Also, in October 2023, the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex") was notified of
the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against it for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the
supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods and retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related
services. On December 12, 2024, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México ("COFECE") issued a split decision
that Walmex's subsidiary had engaged in a single relative monopolistic practice in relation to the negotiation of two types of
contributions with its suppliers. The resolution imposed a monetary penalty on Walmex's subsidiary and certain non-structural
conduct measures. Walmex and its business operations may continue to be closely

monitored and subject to heightened scrutiny from regulatory authorities on these matters leading to possible negative publicity,
additional litigation proceedings and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business
operations, financial position and results of operations.
We are also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission regarding our money transfer agent services and are also
cooperating with and responding to subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on
behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding our consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance
related to our money transfer services, where we are an agent. We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or
investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can provide no assurance as to the
scope and outcome of these matters and whether our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be
materially adversely affected.
We discuss in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3. Legal
Proceedings" and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum
for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for
our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to
obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Delaware Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for certain shareholder claims,
including derivative claims alleging a violation of duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder, unless we
agree otherwise in writing. This exclusive forum provision may increase the cost for shareholders to bring claims or limit their
ability to choose a favorable forum, potentially discouraging lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court finds this provision unenforceable,
we may face higher costs resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively impact our business and financial
results. However, this provision does not affect the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of federal courts over actions brought under
the federal securities laws, including the Exchange Act, as amended, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.
Not satisfying stakeholder expectations with respect to our ESG efforts could adversely affect our reputation or subject us
to regulatory or litigation risk.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business, although stakeholder expectations continue to evolve and are not uniform,
and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain areas. We have established, and may continue to
establish, various goals and initiatives on certain matters, including with respect to climate change, waste, packaging, plastic usage
and other topics. We periodically publish information about our shared value priorities, strategies, progress and challenges through
our online ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control,
and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our goals or that our initiatives will achieve their desired results. Consequently, it is
possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals and certain customers, associates,
shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies and non-governmental organizations might not be
satisfied with our progress. Furthermore, federal, state and local regulatory authorities, private organizations and individuals may
challenge our approach to ESG issues, including allegations that we failed in our efforts, should not have undertaken such efforts or
that we improperly engaged with other entities in our approach to ESG issues. These challenges could involve administrative
proceedings or litigation, including as class or mass actions. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals or to otherwise meet
evolving and diverse stakeholder expectations could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or
customer or shareholder support.

CYBERSECURITY
Walmart seeks to build and maintain the trust of customers, associates, shareholders and other stakeholders with respect to our use
of technology and data. Our digital trust commitments, in line with our Company's values of service, excellence, integrity and
respect for the individual, provide a foundation for our approach to cybersecurity.
The Board of Directors, committees of the Board of Directors and management coordinate risk oversight and management
responsibilities, and cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall approach to enterprise risk management. In
general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach focused on protecting business operations and
preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity
threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.

Board of Directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats
Our Board of Directors, which has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, has delegated risk management
oversight responsibility for information systems, information security, data privacy and cybersecurity to the Audit Committee.
Several of our Board members, including certain members of our Audit Committee, have backgrounds or professional experience
in risk management, digital platforms, information technology or cybersecurity.
The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"), Chief Technology Officer
("CTO") and other members of management on risks related to information systems, information security, data privacy and
cybersecurity. Specific topics may include updates to our company's approach to cybersecurity risk management; recent
developments; key initiatives; the threat landscape; trends; and the results of certain assessments and testing. The Board of
Directors receives regular reports from the Audit Committee chair on these and other risk-related matters as deemed necessary. Our
CISO or other members of management provide information to the Audit Committee pursuant to risk-based escalation protocols for
cybersecurity incidents that exceed established reporting thresholds.
Management's role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats
Our CISO leads Walmart's Information Security organization and has responsibility for overseeing our Company's cybersecurity
program. To operationalize our program, we deploy multidisciplinary teams, including cybersecurity personnel and professionals,
to address cybersecurity threats and respond to cybersecurity incidents, including for those recently acquired and non-wholly
owned subsidiaries whose systems have not been fully integrated into Walmart's networks. Through ongoing engagement with
these teams and certain third-party service providers, our CISO monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of
cybersecurity threats and incidents and reports cybersecurity incidents that reach established thresholds to senior management and
the Audit Committee, which are also analyzed for external reporting requirements.
Our CISO has been a Walmart associate for over 30 years, has served in various roles in information technology and information
security at Walmart for more than 20 years, and has received industry-recognized information security certifications. Our CTO, to
whom the CISO reports, has served as Walmart's CTO since 2019 and prior to that had experience managing technology and other
risks at several other large public companies.
Risk Management and Strategy
Our cybersecurity program is informed by various industry frameworks including the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST-CSF), which are reflected in our related policies, standards, processes and practices.
We may implement changes to our cybersecurity program when deemed appropriate based on updates to laws or industry standards
among other things. We have multiple layers of security designed to detect and prevent cybersecurity events, as well as dedicated
teams of cybersecurity personnel and professionals, which assist our CISO in helping to assess, identify, monitor, detect and
manage cybersecurity risks, threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. We collaborate with public and private entities and industry
groups and engage third-party service providers to expand the capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program when deemed
appropriate. Certain key components of our cybersecurity program include the following:
Protecting our technology and information systems: When we implement significant changes to our technologies or information
systems, we conduct risk-based security and privacy impact assessments and deploy technical safeguards that are designed to
reasonably protect our technology and information systems from cybersecurity threats. We actively monitor and proactively
research potential cybersecurity threats to our technologies and information systems. We use what we learn to evolve our security
controls over time to mitigate risks posed by such threats.
Incident response and recovery planning: We maintain incident response and recovery plans that address our response to
cybersecurity incidents, including incidents that we become aware of at third parties that support our operations. These plans guide
how we evaluate and assign incident severity levels and reporting thresholds; escalate and engage incident response teams; and
manage and mitigate the related risks.
Third-party risk management: We maintain a risk-based approach to identifying and managing cybersecurity threats presented to
Walmart by third-party systems that support our operations, as well as third-party users of our data and systems, including vendors,
service providers and subcontractors.
Training and awareness: We provide recurring information security training (which includes cybersecurity training) to our
associates and certain third parties based on access, risk, roles, policies, standards and behaviors.
Assessments and testing: We engage in periodic assessment and testing of our policies, standards, processes and practices that are
designed to address cybersecurity threats. These efforts include tabletop exercises, threat modeling, vulnerability testing and other
exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. We regularly engage assessors,
consultants, auditors or other third parties to assist with our assessments and testing. Where appropriate we adjust our cybersecurity
policies, standards, processes and practices accordingly based on internal and external assessment and testing results.

Certain of Walmart's systems and those of our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents and threats.
Based on the information available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks from
cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected us or are reasonably likely
to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our security measures,
however, there can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident
in the future that will materially affect us. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in "Item 1A. Risk
Factors," which should be read in conjunction with the information above.

In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA")
alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and repair program at certain
of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA may seek to
impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that this process is in
an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter. Although the Company does not believe this
matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can
provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely
affected.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
Overview
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025"), January 31, 2024 ("fiscal
2024") and January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the
accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our
financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors
that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's
performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our
business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management
measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead
allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other
measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.
Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the
performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period
from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for
the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the
eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through
our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales.
Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by
a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested
businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been
owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method
of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the
operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency
exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate
fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results
of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates have impacted and
may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International
segment.
We have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and
supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S.
segment completed the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of $1.9 billion. Additionally, we have taken
actions in the Walmart International segment to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last three years:
•
In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary
(Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.
•
In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart
subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.
•
In August 2024, we sold our equity investment in JD.com for net proceeds of $3.6 billion. Refer to Note 8.
We operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition
from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as
eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are
national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete
with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by
a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global
health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns,
consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange
rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic

conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and
unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an
investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low
costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost
increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on
to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food
categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are
not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label
brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories;
and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of
net sales.
We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions;
fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in
employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of
operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below.
Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low
costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we
operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:
•
Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;
•
Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and
•
Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.
Growth
Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through
our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at
Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that
complement our strategy.
Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for
such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The
retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with
the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we
discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which
may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S.
as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary
market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.
Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:

Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.8% and 4.9% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the
previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 4.8% and 5.5% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For fiscal
2025, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and
wellness. For fiscal 2024, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket,
including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness.Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately
2.9% and 2.6% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and
delivery.
Comparable sales at Sam's Club U.S. increased 4.7% and 2.3% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For fiscal 2025, Sam's Club
U.S. comparable sales increased due to growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and

including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower
fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.3% and
1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and
delivery.
Margin
Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of
productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase
productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the
efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a
faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses. Additionally, we focus on our mix of
businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective
is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing
prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix
shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns
incurred in the prior year.    
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of
exceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily
due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and
restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the
factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.
Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with
our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends,
which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA") and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the
most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a
meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends
in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that
exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA
is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus
interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital
during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average
accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although
ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by
management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

--- Page 45 ---
ROA was 7.9% and 6.6% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in
consolidated net income during the trailing 12 month period, as a result of higher operating income and changes in the fair value of
our equity and other investments. ROI was 15.5% and 15.0% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in ROI was the
result of an increase in operating income, primarily due to improvements in business performance, partially offset by an increase in
average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP
financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures
our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the
Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated
net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See
Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used
in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made
in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.4 billion, $35.7 billion and $28.8 billion for fiscal 2025,
2024 and 2023, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $12.7 billion, $15.1 billion and $12.0 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and
2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 is primarily due to an increase in cash
provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year, partially offset by
increased inventory purchases. Free cash flow for fiscal 2025 decreased when compared to fiscal 2024 due to an increase of $3.2
billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy, partially offset by the increase in net cash provided by operating
activities described above. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2024 increased when compared to fiscal 2023
primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory
management as part of working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free
cash flow for fiscal 2024 increased when compared to fiscal 2023 due to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities
described above, partially offset by an increase of $3.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary
expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual
obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure
that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a
result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to
calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating
activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information
regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

     Membership and other income includes membership fees and other items such as rental and tenant income, recycling income, gift card breakage income, as
well as other income from corporate campus facilities.
     Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales. Operating expenses refers to operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.
Our total revenues increased $32.9 billion or 5.1% and $36.8 billion or 6.0% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when
compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased
$31.9 billion or 5.0% and $36.8 billion or 6.1% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
The increases were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales across our U.S. segments and international markets, driven
primarily by growth in transactions and unit volumes, which included strength in eCommerce as well as strong sales in grocery,
and health and wellness. Net sales were negatively impacted by $3.2 billion and positively impacted by $3.0 billion of fluctuations
in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Membership and other income increased $1.0 billion and
$0.1 billion for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, primarily driven by growth in membership fee income globally.
Our gross profit rate increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal
year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic
price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise
categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.
Our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a
result of exceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was
primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the
reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.
Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or
losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of net
losses of $0.8 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which primarily consisted of changes in fair value of
our equity and other investments driven by changes in their underlying stock prices.
Our effective income tax rate was 23.4%, 25.5%, and 33.6% for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in effective
tax rate in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 is primarily due to the tax impact on changes in fair value of our investments. The
higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 is primarily related to the tax impacts of the
separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including
changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances, business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry
into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, changes in tax law, changes in the administrative practices,
principles, and interpretations related to tax, and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international
operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the
U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 is provided in Note 9.

As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $20.2 billion and $16.3 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2025
and 2024, respectively, which represents an increase of $3.9 billion and $5.0 billion for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when

$1.42 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $20.6 billion or 4.7% and $21.3 billion or 5.1% for fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable
sales of 4.8% and 5.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2025 were driven by growth in
transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales in fiscal 2024 were driven
by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.9% and 2.6% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery.
Membership and other income increased $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, primarily driven by growth in
membership fee income from Walmart+ and recycling income.
Gross profit rate increased 47 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
The increase in fiscal 2025 gross profit rate was primarily driven by managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps
and growth in higher margin businesses, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. The increase in
fiscal 2024 gross profit rate was primarily due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher
net markdowns incurred in the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 and 9 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased marketing expenses, higher
variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance and increased depreciation expenses. For fiscal 2024, the increase was
driven by higher variable pay relative to the prior year as a result of exceeding our planned performance.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2025 and
2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $7.2 billion or 6.3% and $13.7 billion or 13.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable
sales in all of our international markets, which included strength in eCommerce, partially offset by negative fluctuations in
currency exchange rates of $3.2 billion. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales across our
international markets and positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $3.0 billion.
Gross profit rate increased 20 basis points for both fiscal 2025 and 2024 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2025, the increase was primarily due to improved eCommerce margin and business mix changes, partially offset by ongoing
channel and format mix changes. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies partially offset by
ongoing channel and format mix shifts.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 5 and 152 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2025
was primarily due to increased sales driving expense leverage, partially offset by planned investments in associate wages and
strategic priorities in Mexico and Central America. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for
fiscal 2024, was primarily due to the lapping of business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to Flipkart and
Massmart in fiscal 2023 and an increase in sales in fiscal 2024.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.6 billion and $1.9 billion for fiscal 2025 and
2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

 We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club U.S. segment's fuel
sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the
Sam's Club U.S. segment in the future.
Net sales for the Sam's Club U.S. segment increased $4.1 billion or 4.7% and $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable
sales, including fuel, of 4.7% and 2.3% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2025 were driven by
growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales in fiscal 2024
were driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Additionally,
fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S.
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.3% and 1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.
Membership and other income increased 13.3% and 7.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous
fiscal year. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, the increases were primarily due to growth in membership base and Plus penetration. Fiscal
2025 and 2024 were also positively impacted by the expiration of a promotional offering offsetting membership fee increases
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
Gross profit rate increased 37 and 55 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
For fiscal 2025, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies related to merchandise flow
and increased margins in fuel, partially offset by higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. For fiscal 2024, the increase in gross profit
rate was primarily due to the lapping of elevated markdowns in the prior year. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 gross profit rates
were partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 and 46 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2025 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to
increased compensation related expenses, including associate wage investments and higher variable pay as a result of exceeding
our planned performance, as well as elevated technology spend. Fiscal 2024 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased primarily due to lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.2 billion for both fiscal 2025 and 2024,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows
provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our
operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of
the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our
sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our investment activities, pay dividends and fund our
share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

28,841 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $36.4 billion, $35.7 billion and $28.8 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025, when compared to the previous fiscal year, is
primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the
prior year, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal
2024, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing
of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the
remaining accrued opioid legal charges.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit
Cash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our working capital
deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $17.1 billion and $15.5 billion as of January 31, 2025 and
2024, respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings for
general corporate purposes and accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially offset by increased inventories and
receivables related to higher sales growth. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in
funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of
cash dividends and share repurchases.
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed
with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside
of the U.S. Under current law, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes
such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, or other existing limitations on anticipated future
repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of
operations.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely
transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest
shareholders.

Net cash used in investing activities was $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion and $17.7 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and generally consisted of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.1 billion for fiscal 2025 when
compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to increased purchases of property and equipment as well as the
acquisition of VIZIO for net consideration of $1.9 billion, partially offset by net proceeds received from sales of certain strategic
investments, including $3.6 billion related to the sale of our JD.com investment. Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.6
billion for fiscal 2024 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increased payments for property and equipment.
Capital expenditures
Refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal
2025 and 2024. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026 ("fiscal 2026"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately
$21 billion to $25 billion, with a focus on technology, supply chain and customer-facing initiatives.

Net cash used in financing activities generally consisted of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and
transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Fiscal 2025 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.4 billion when
compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to lapping debt issuances in the prior fiscal year and increased
share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests in the prior fiscal year and higher short-term
borrowings. Fiscal 2024 net cash used in financing activities decreased $3.6 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The
decrease was primarily due to fewer share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests.
Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2024, we paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the
liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, we received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of
equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary.
During fiscal 2023, we completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary and
completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, bringing our ownership to approximately 100% of both Massmart and
Alert Innovation. The Alert Innovation entity was subsequently sold and deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.
Short-term Borrowings
We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments,
share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to
our short-term borrowings for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:

interest rates of 5.3% and 7.7%, respectively. We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S.
as of January 31, 2025 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities
outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed.
As of January 31, 2025, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.5 billion was drawn
and represents an unrecorded current obligation.

Our total outstanding long-term debt decreased $3.6 billion during fiscal 2025, primarily due to maturities of certain long-term
debt. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt.
Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $18.2 billion, with approximately $1.7
billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2026. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities
of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2025, and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments.

Dividends
Our total dividend payments were $6.7 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Effective
February 20, 2025, the Company approved the fiscal 2026 annual dividend of $0.94 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2025
annual dividend of $0.83 per share. For fiscal 2026, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.235 per
share, according to the following record and payable dates:

Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the
Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2025 were made under the current $20.0 billion share
repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which
the Company can make repurchases. As of January 31, 2025, authorization for $12.0 billion of share repurchases remained under
the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases,
including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the
market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through
the Company's free cash flow.
The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total
amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:

Material Cash Requirements
Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes,
interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and
related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is
due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility
purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding
service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and
legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or
variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a
portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are
excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders
represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs
and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the
obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without
significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or
services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Capital Resources
We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will
continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal
buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.

We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our
debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2025, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper
and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency
  
Commercial paper
  
Long-term debt
Standard & Poor's
  
A-1+
  
AA
Moody's Investors Service
  
P-1
  
Aa2
Fitch Ratings
  
F1+
  
AA
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be
subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent
over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic
environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our
business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair
our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current
short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have
experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating
agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and
disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates
and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These
judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our
estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed
in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of
the financial statements.
Contingencies
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss
contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of
amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial
statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review
all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a

--- Page 56 ---
reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably
estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not
recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements
of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our
financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand
challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any
changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition
threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Accordingly, the determination
of our uncertain tax positions requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of
complex tax laws.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate
potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is
calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another,
which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our
interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2025, the
net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $43 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term
debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For
interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity
date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the
contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2025.

represented 20% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2025 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in
prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion.

Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the
U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2025, movements in currency exchange rates and the
related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $2.2 billion net loss in the currency translation and other
category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a
liability position of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The change in the fair
value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the weakening of certain currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2025. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.6 billion. A
hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2025 would have
resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of
purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain
immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option, measured on a recurring basis. The amounts of
gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes for these investments are recorded within other gains and losses and,
along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in a net loss of $0.8 billion in fiscal 2025 primarily due to net
decreases in the underlying stock prices of these investments. As of January 31, 2025, the fair value of our equity investments,
including certain immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option, measured on a recurring basis
was $3.0 billion. As of January 31, 2025, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the
fair value of such investments by approximately $0.3 billion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2025 and 2024,
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated Financial
Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated March 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as
a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter
or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.
Contingencies
Description of the
Matter
As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2025, the Company is
involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability
for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when management determines it is probable that a loss
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses
when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. In assessing the probability of
occurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal proceeding,
management exercises judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding. Auditing management's accounting
for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment
of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of loss for contingencies
or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.

How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over
the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company's
assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the measurement of loss.
To test the Company's assessment of the probability of loss or determination of an estimate of loss, or range
of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and
committees of the board of directors, reviewed documents provided to the Company by certain outside legal
counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside legal counsel, evaluated the current
status of contingencies based on discussions with internal and outside legal counsel, and obtained
representations from management. We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31,
2025, and the related notes and our report dated March 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Walmart Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping
people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through
eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly
integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025"), January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") and January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"). Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been
determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in common stock or in-substance
common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity
method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.")
and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar
year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2025 related to the operations consolidated using a
lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"). Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.
Common Stock Split
On February 23, 2024, the Company effected a 3-for-1 forward split of its common stock and a proportionate increase in the
number of authorized shares. All share and per share information, including share based compensation, has been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.10 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal
to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from capital in excess of par value to common
stock.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card,
debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The
amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion as of
January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion in
cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, approximately 62% and 60% were held outside of the U.S.,
respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's
non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which
it is needed with the minimum cost possible.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not
be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest
shareholders.

Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following:
customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies, advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic
transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for
income taxes; and real estate transactions. Net receivables from transactions with customers were $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion as of
January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively.
Inventories
The Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store
formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net
realizable value, as appropriate.
•
Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting ("RIM")
to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory
being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail
value of inventory.
•
Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for
using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method.
•
Sam's Club U.S. Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-
average cost LIFO method.
For those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected
annual effect of inflation or deflation. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for inflation or deflation
and inventory levels.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of
major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table
summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to
depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining
expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and
intangible assets for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $13.0 billion, $11.9 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.
Leases
For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.
The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially
recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is
not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum
of the lease payments.
Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is
reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease
obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For
leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as
common area maintenance, utilities and repairs and maintenance.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the
individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets'
useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable,
any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate
market appraisal or other valuation technique.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is
allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as
determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable
segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill and
other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for
each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative
goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors,
that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit
substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.
The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is
measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its
evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly,
the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill during fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2025 and 2024:

Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2025 relates to the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. in December 2024 within the Walmart U.S. segment.
Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2025 and
2024, the Company had $4.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of
acquired trade names. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset
is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to
engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a
transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more
information.
Investments
Investments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair
value of certain equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair
value option, are measured on a recurring basis (generally using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) and
recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain
other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $0.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and

2023, respectively, primarily due to net changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments. Refer to Note 8 for details.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or
impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and included in other long-term assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and adjustments in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The Company had debt securities classified as trading of $1.2 billion as of both January 31, 2025 and
January 31, 2024, the majority of which is mandatorily redeemable in fiscal 2029, related to its retained investment in Asda, the
Company's former retail operations in the U.K. The fair value of this investment is primarily estimated (generally using Level 3
inputs in the fair value hierarchy) by discounting the future cash flows over the remaining period until the mandatory redemption
date at an appropriate discount rate reflecting Asda’s credit risk.
Indemnification Liabilities
The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with previous divestitures and has recorded indemnification
liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, the Company had $0.6
billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Maximum potential future payments under these indemnities was $3.1 billion, based on exchange
rates as of January 31, 2025.
Supplier Financing Program Obligations
The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial
institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these
programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial
institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due.
The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90
days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship
with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions
are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from
the financial institution. The rollforward of the Company's outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these
programs is as follows:
(Amounts in millions)
Fiscal 2025
Confirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of the year
$
5,271 
Invoices confirmed during the year
41,335 
Confirmed invoices paid during the year
(40,810)
Translation and other
(71)
Confirmed obligations outstanding at the end of the year
$
5,725 
These obligations are generally classified as accounts payable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these
programs is classified as an operating activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability,
product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to
estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for
claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim
payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to
some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage

Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as
well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the
Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including
setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Company
enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties,
but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's collateral
arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects
of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash collateral provided to
counterparties under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2025 and 2024.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative
is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the
same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not
elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an
unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on
maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity
date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of
fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method
requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset
changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from September 2028 to
September 2031.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure
associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records
changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings
in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April
2026 to January 2039.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more
likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and
other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the
adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent
differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in
tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9
for additional income tax disclosures.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented
as temporary equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the
redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and
any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in
capital in excess of par. The Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S.
segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in
December 2027, with annual options thereafter.
Revenue Recognition    
Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or provides
services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated
sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.
Financial, Advertising and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services
is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Membership and Other Income
Membership and other income primarily includes membership fee revenue associated with the Company's various membership
offerings for customers and members across each reportable segment. Membership fee revenue is recognized over the term of the
membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2024
and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Additionally, membership and other income includes items such as rental and tenant income, recycling income and
gift card breakage income.
Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise
using the gift card, thus a liability for deferred gift card revenue is recorded within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Refer to Note 5. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and
members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company
does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both
with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes gift
card breakage income for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income
over the expected redemption period.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes costs of merchandise sold and services performed; costs of transporting merchandise to the Company's
distribution facilities, stores, clubs, and customers; and also includes warehousing costs for the Sam's Club U.S. segment and
import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments, except in certain situations as described below.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and
reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-
specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and recognized in the Company's
Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in situations when the payment is in exchange for a
distinct good or service or a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.

Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company (except cost of sales, as
described above), which comprise substantially all labor-related, depreciation and amortization, maintenance and repairs, utilities,
and other general operating costs incurred in stores, clubs and other facilities. The majority of the cost of warehousing and
occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general
and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart
International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be
comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the
calculation of gross profit.
As a result, the Company’s cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for each of its reportable
segments may not be comparable to those of other retailers.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, and consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements that are recorded in
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs
were $5.1 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the
respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment
Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant
segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the ASU for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025
on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented in the financial statements, which includes disclosure of cost of sales and
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses by segment. See Note 12.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which
expands the requirements for income tax disclosures in order to provide greater transparency. The amendments are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively,
although optional retrospective application is permitted. Management intends to adopt the amendments prospectively for the fiscal
year ending January 31, 2026 and is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures. The
amendments only impact disclosures and are not expected to have an impact on the Company's financial condition and results of
operations.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense
Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires incremental
disclosures about specific expense categories, including but not limited to, purchases of inventory, employee compensation,
depreciation, amortization and selling expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026,
and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments
may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the
Company's disclosures. The amendments only impact disclosures and are not expected to have an impact on the Company's
financial condition and results of operations.
Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during
the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common
shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards as determined under the
treasury stock method. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not
included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.

The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 33.0 billion, of which 8.0 billion and 8.1 billion were issued and
outstanding as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock is 0.1
billion; none of which were issued or outstanding for any period presented.
Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2024, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle
the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. The Company's ownership of Flipkart increased from
approximately 75% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85% as of January 31, 2024.
Also during fiscal 2024, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority
owned PhonePe subsidiary, which decreased the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to
approximately 84% as of January 31, 2024.
During fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's
Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%.
Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a
variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner. This entity was subsequently sold and
deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.
Also during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to approximately 89% as part
of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company
initially recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities in the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, which was paid during fiscal 2024.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation
expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated
subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and
2023, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based
compensation was $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table

under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of
its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
•
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in
fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of approximately 8% each quarter over a three year period from
the date of grant. For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of
25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined
on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is
recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the
vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock
units granted in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was 2.0%, 2.2% and 2.3%, respectively.
•
Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on
the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest
based on a one-year performance period followed by a two-year vesting period based on the passage of time. Vesting
conditions during the performance period are based on achieving pre-established financial goals for metrics related to
growth and returns and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for restricted stock
are generally between one month and three years. Vesting periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally
between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or, in certain
circumstances, deferred and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of
performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for
the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period if it is probable that
performance conditions will be achieved. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair
value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was 3.2%, 3.3% and 3.3%, respectively.
In addition to the Plan, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have share-based compensation plans for associates under which
options to acquire their own common shares are issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included
in the Other line in the table above.

As of January 31, 2025, the Company also has approximately $3 billion in unrecognized compensation cost (based on grant-date
fair value) primarily associated with share-based compensation plans of certain subsidiaries which contain performance or other
conditions including vesting upon an initial public offering. If such conditions are ultimately satisfied, unrecognized compensation
cost would be recognized in the applicable reporting period.
Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the
Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2025 were made under the current $20.0 billion share
repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which
the Company can make repurchases. As of January 31, 2025 authorization for $12.0 billion of share repurchases remained under
the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share
repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and
the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares
repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:

 Upon closing of the noncontrolling interest shareholder buyout of the Company's Massmart subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the cumulative
amount of currency translation was reallocated from the Company's noncontrolling interest back to the Company. Refer to Note 3.
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for cash flow hedges are generally recorded in interest, net, in
the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts reclassified related to the cumulative translation for settlements of
foreign-denominated bonds and associated cross-currency swaps are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 6. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt
Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit. Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2025 and 2024
were $3.1 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 5.3% and 7.7%, respectively.
The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. to support its commercial paper program which are summarized in
the following table:

     In April 2024, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility as well as its five year credit facility.
The committed lines of credit in the table above mature in April 2025 and April 2029, carry interest rates of the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate plus 55 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the
committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of
which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit
available which totaled $2.1 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, of which $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion was drawn as of
January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8, consists of the following as

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its
own assumptions.
As described in Note 1, the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain immaterial equity
method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes for
these investments are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these
investments is as follows:

4,414 
Total
$
3,041 
$
7,249 
The fair value of these investments decreased $4.2 billion during fiscal 2025, primarily due to the sale of the Company's investment
in JD.com in August 2024, as well as gains and losses resulting from net changes in the underlying stock prices of the investments,
along with certain other immaterial investment activity. The fair value of these investments decreased $3.4 billion during fiscal
2024 primarily due to gains and losses resulting from net changes in the underlying stock prices, along with certain other
immaterial investment activity.
Sale of Investment
In August 2024, the Company sold its investment in JD.com for net proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion and recorded a realized
loss of $0.3 billion within other gains and losses.

Derivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would
receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured
using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of
January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment
charges.
The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31,
2025 and January 31, 2024.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these
instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable prices
of identical instruments in less active markets. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31,
2025 and 2024, are as follows:

Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2025, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $32.4 billion. Of
these carryforwards, approximately $18.5 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2045. The remaining
carryforwards have no expiration.
The realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable
income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a
deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation

--- Page 84 ---
allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be
recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $7.4 billion and $7.5 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024,
respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a
more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.8 billion
and $3.5 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate
was $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general
and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2025,
2024 and 2023. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax
benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their
disallowance. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 2024.
The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2024, and for
U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2018 through 2024. With few exceptions, the Company is no
longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these
examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the
respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of
possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the
Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for
those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred.
From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement
agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company
can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss,
beyond the amounts accrued, if any, that may arise from these matters.

Settlement of Certain Opioid-Related Matters
The Company entered into settlement agreements with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, three U.S. territories,
and the vast majority of eligible political subdivisions and federally recognized Native American tribes to resolve opioid-related
claims against the Company. In fiscal year 2023, the Company accrued a liability of approximately $3.3 billion for these
settlements, which include amounts for remediation of alleged harms, attorneys' fees, and costs. As of January 31, 2025, all of the
accrued liability has been paid. Remaining eligible political subdivisions and federally recognized Native American tribes
have until July 15, 2025 and February 24, 2026, respectively, to join these settlements. The Company will owe no additional funds
for any eligible political subdivision or federally recognized Native American tribe that elects to join the settlement.
Ongoing Opioid-Related Litigation
The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related matters not settled or otherwise resolved, including,
but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party
payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that elects not to join the settlement described
above. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related matters nor can the Company reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcome of any of the opioid-related matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash
flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Opioid Multidistrict Litigation; Other Opioid-Related Matters in the U.S. and Canada. In December 2017, the United States
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various
plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals and third-party payers, asserting
claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re
National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some cases included in the MDL.
A trial involving claims brought by two counties against certain defendants, including the Company, in the MDL resulted in a
judgment on August 17, 2022 that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of
approximately $0.7 billion over 15 years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The
monetary aspect of the judgment was stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February
20, 2023, which did not materially impact the Company's operations. The Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals, which issued an order certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. On December
10, 2024, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued an order certifying the law and holding that the Ohio Product Liability Act bars all
common law public nuisance claims arising from the sale of a product. On January 31, 2025, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
entered an order vacating the approximately $0.7 billion judgment, dissolving the injunction, and remanding the case back to the
MDL for further proceedings.
Additional opioid-related cases against the Company remain pending in the MDL and in state and federal courts. The plaintiffs
include healthcare providers, third-party payers, individuals and others and seek compensatory and punitive damages and
injunctive relief, including abatement. Four cases brought by third-party payers and one case brought by a hospital have been
selected as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery in the MDL, and the MDL Court may designate additional bellwether
cases in the future. The Florida Health Sciences Center case pending in state court in Florida asserts claims on behalf of several
hospital systems against the Company and other defendants, and this matter is scheduled for jury trial beginning on September 18,
2025.
The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to
nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.
Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two putative class action
complaints filed in Canada related to distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain pending.
Department of Justice Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled
substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that
this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. On
March 11, 2024, the Court granted in-part Walmart's motion to dismiss by dismissing the entirety of the DOJ's claims related to
distribution and dismissing the DOJ's claims arising under one of the DOJ's two dispensing liability theories. The DOJ's claims
arising under its other dispensing liability theory remain pending. Trial is scheduled for November 2027.
Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions. The Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the
federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids purportedly on behalf of a class of investors
who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. Those actions were filed in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware in 2021 and later consolidated. On April 8, 2024, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss
these actions. On April 29, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where the matter remains pending.

Opioid-Related Shareholder Derivative Litigation.
Three shareholders of the Company filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain current and
former directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately oversee the Company's distribution and
dispensing of prescription opioids. This action was entitled Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund, et al. v.
Walton, et al., Delaware Court of Chancery, Case No. 2021-0827-JTL ("Ontario Action"). Other shareholders of the Company filed
two derivative actions alleging that certain current and former directors and officers breached fiduciary duties and violated federal
securities laws in connection with the Company's distribution and dispensing of prescription opioids. Those actions were entitled
Abt v. Alvarez, et al., U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 21-cv-00172-CFC and Nguyen v. McMillon, et al.,
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 21-cv-00551-CFC (collectively with the Ontario Action, the "Derivative
Actions"). On May 5, 2023, the Walmart Board of Directors adopted resolutions creating a special litigation committee ("SLC") to
investigate, review, and analyze the facts and circumstances surrounding the claims and allegations in the Derivative Actions and
determine whether the prosecution of such claims is in Walmart's best interest.
The Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final order and judgment on December 20, 2024, granting approval to a settlement of
the Derivative Actions. Pursuant to this order and judgment (i) insurance carriers funded a $123 million settlement, of which
$24.6 million was awarded to plaintiffs' counsel for attorneys' fees and the balance was awarded to the Company; and (ii) the
Company agreed to maintain certain corporate governance practices for a period of at least five years. The settlement does not
include any admission of liability, and the defendants expressly deny any wrongdoing. The Company received settlement proceeds
of approximately $99 million on December 24, 2024 and recorded it as a reduction to operating, selling, general, and administrative
expense. The Abt and Nguyen actions were dismissed on January 16, 2025.
False Claims Act Litigation. On August 23, 2019, a qui tam action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Mexico. The action was partially unsealed on April 30, 2024 after the federal government declined to intervene. The DOJ informed
the Company of its decision not to intervene on June 20, 2024. On July 25, 2024, the Court transferred the litigation to the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware. On January 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on behalf of two
former pharmacists of the Company as relators that alleges the Company violated the Controlled Substances Act and state
pharmacy regulations and that such conduct constitutes violations of the federal False Claims Act. The Company intends to file a
renewed motion to dismiss.
Other Legal Proceedings
Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in
2008 and are proceeding in the United Kingdom before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester and before the High Court. Claims
have been brought by approximately 70,000 current and former Asda store employees who allege their work is of equal value to the
work done by employees in Asda's distribution centers and that the difference in pay and conditions between the different jobs is
not objectively justified. Additional employees may assert claims in the future. The legal proceedings to consider these equal value
claims are in three phases, and the first phase is complete. Certain claims remain under consideration in the second phase. On
January 31, 2025, the Employment Tribunal issued a ruling that certain of the claims are permitted to advance to the third phase.
There are factual and legal defenses to the equal value claims, and the Company intends to vigorously defend them. Subsequent to
the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While
potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of
these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may ultimately
be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the
Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters.
Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States
Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's
consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services,
where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. Walmart's responses to DOJ's subpoenas have
been complete since 2021. The Company continues to cooperate with the DOJ's review. The Company has also responded to civil
investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation
related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent.
On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer
agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. Following rulings on Walmart's motion to dismiss, the FTC
filed an amended complaint on June 30, 2023. On July 3, 2024, the Court granted in part Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended
complaint by dismissing with prejudice the claims under the Telemarketing Sales Rule but denying the motion to dismiss with
respect to claims for injunctive relief under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On October 18, 2024, the Court
certified its rulings on the motions to dismiss for interlocutory appeal and stayed discovery. On October 28, 2024, Walmart filed a
petition for interlocutory appeal with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The petition for interlocutory appeal was granted on
November 18, 2024. The Company's appellate brief was filed on February 12, 2025.

The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can
provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely
affected.
Driver Platform Matters. On December 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") filed a lawsuit against the
Company and Branch Messenger, Inc. in the District of Minnesota alleging the Company violated the Consumer Financial
Protection Act by allegedly requiring independent contractor drivers on the Spark platform to receive payments through a financial
product offered by Branch. The CFPB seeks an injunction and unspecified restitution, damages, and civil penalties. On February
20, 2025, the Court entered an order that indefinitely stays the case and vacates all deadlines.
The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from other governmental entities
regarding the independent contractor classification of drivers and payment and operational practices with respect to the driver
platform. The Company is also defending putative class and representative action civil litigation relating to driver classification and
defending other civil litigation and arbitration claims in connection with the driver platform.
The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and

Mexico Antitrust Matter. On October 6, 2023, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México ("COFECE") notified
the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), a majority owned subsidiary of the
Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority ("IA") had recommended the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process
against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of
certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. On December 12, 2024, after
Walmex provided defenses, produced expert evidence and participated in a hearing, COFECE issued a split decision that Walmex's
subsidiary had engaged in a single relative monopolistic practice in relation to the negotiation of two types of contributions with its
suppliers. The resolution imposed a monetary penalty on Walmex's subsidiary in the amount of $93.4 million pesos (approximately
$5 million U.S. dollars) and certain non-structural conduct measures relating to the two prohibited types of supplier contributions
(while recognizing that other supplier contributions can continue). On January 6, 2025, Walmex's subsidiary challenged COFECE's
resolution through an appeal in the specialized federal courts. Until the appeal is resolved, Walmex's subsidiary will operate in
compliance with COFECE's ruling. Payment of the monetary penalty is stayed until the lawsuit is resolved.
Foreign Direct Investment Matters. In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart
Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and
former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under
India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged
violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018 (the
"Notice"), in addition to more recent requests for information from the Directorate of Enforcement to Flipkart for periods prior and
subsequent to April 2016 regarding the Rules, including the most recent request in February 2025 (the "Requests"). The Notice is
an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a
hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the Notice. If a hearing is initiated, whether with respect to the Notice
or from further proceedings related to the Requests, and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, then the regulatory
authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief, such as share ownership restrictions. Flipkart has been
responding to the Notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the Notice,
Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that the process regarding the Notice is in the early
stages, the Company is unable to predict whether the Notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of
the resulting proceedings, as well as whether any further proceedings will arise with respect to the Requests. The Company cannot
reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope or
outcome of any proceeding that might result from the Notice or the Requests, or the amount of the proceeds the Company may
receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement for the period
prior to the date the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and further can provide no assurance that its business,
financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.

India Antitrust Matter. On January 13, 2020, the Competition Commission of India ("CCI") ordered its Director General (the
"DG") to investigate certain matters alleging competition law violations by certain subsidiaries of Flipkart in India and other
parties. On September 13, 2024, those subsidiaries received a non-confidential version of the DG's Investigation Report (the
"Report"), alleging certain competition law violations. CCI is not bound by the Report, and will conduct its independent analysis of
the allegations, including hearing objections from the subsidiaries and other parties before issuing its final order in the matter,
which could include monetary and non-monetary relief. CCI's final order would also be subject to appropriate appellate
proceedings. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter, cannot reasonably estimate any
loss or range of loss that may arise, and can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash
flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan
immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin
to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches
100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for
each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment
benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they
are established.
The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2025, 2024

Note 12. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites and mobile
applications, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's
operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company
defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), the Company's Chief
Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products
and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and
services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which
includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International
segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's
Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives.
Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.

--- Page 91 ---
The Company measures the profit or loss of its segments using operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate
resources across the reportable segments as part of the Company's long-range and annual planning processes, and to evaluate
planned versus actual results when assessing segment operating performance. From time to time, the Company may revise the
measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, and presentation of significant
segment expenses, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. The operating results of each reportable
segment, including the mix of cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, are not directly comparable
due to differences in business model, format and channel mix. Additionally, the operating results of each reportable segment may
not be comparable to those of other retailers, as discussed in Note 1. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for
Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided as follows:

Disaggregated Revenues
In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. In addition, net sales related
to eCommerce are provided for each segment. Net sales related to eCommerce include omni-channel sales where a customer
initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club, as well as net sales from other business offerings that

DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is
required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating
such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use
judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or
manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we
maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and
processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control
environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems,
automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and
increasing monitoring controls. We are continuing to upgrade our financial systems globally, and modernize functions across the
business which will impact our internal control over financial reporting.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2025 was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2025. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded
that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. The
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in
their report which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
