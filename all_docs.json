In addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part\nupon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials\nfluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For\nexample, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw\nmaterials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our\ntimelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these\nmaterials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot\nrecoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our\nbrand, growth, prospects and operating results. Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles\nin an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile. Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general\nand Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles\ndecreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\nmay be harmed. In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our\nvehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\n•\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n•\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to\ncharging facilities;\n•\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-\neconomy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n•\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\n•\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\n•\nconcerns about our future viability. The target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive.",

In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale\nprices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead\nto an increased rate of customer defaults. Risks Related to Our Operations\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may\nharm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products. Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-\nion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle\ncomponents at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If\nwe are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or\nhire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm\nour business and operating results. Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are\nstored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such\nfacilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety\nissue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business. We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and\nuncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions\nin numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which\nare inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional\nmanufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety\nrequirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing\nforeign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\nenforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and\npreferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a\nglobal basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multi-\njurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability\nto sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them\neffectively.",

Maintaining such\nconfidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with\nour products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand;\ncompetition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production\nand sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In\nparticular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to\nsignificant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or\nunfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions,\nwhether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed. We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to,\nour various financing programs. We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through\nvarious financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in\ncertain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases\ndirectly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease,\nfollowed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar\nenergy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity\ngenerated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations\nand consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties. The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately\nproject our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms\ndepending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles, legislative changes and the pricing\nof new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the\nordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing\nprogram. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If\nwe are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling\nalternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to\ngrow our vehicle deliveries.

If the\nactual resale values of any vehicles resold by our vehicle customers and partners are lower than the residual values we have agreed\nto with them, the residual value guarantees may be triggered and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results may be\nharmed.

We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of\nNew York relating to our Gigafactory New York. We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the\n“SUNY Foundation”). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have\nprimarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage\ncomponents and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions.

Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to\nreplace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs\nof future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with\nrespect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes\nthan our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and\nother claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance\ncoverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have\nmay include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our\ninsurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy\nlimits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant\nrestrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among\nother things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain\namount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and\nengage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to\ncomply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate\nour obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it. Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them. Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows\nmay fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,\nequity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources\nof liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or\naccelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if\nnot required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness.

CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as\nsuch term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual\nproperty theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed\nthrough a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance\nreviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and\ncybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-\nparty tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting,\nconduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including\nour consumer products) and implement appropriate changes. We have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected\nstages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and\nrecovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product\nSecurity, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. Security events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents\nare evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact. We also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals\nthen collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and\nform detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.",

These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be\nexacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any\nindustry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example,\nduring the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of\nthe production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\nresulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack.

For example, as inflationary pressures increased across\nthe markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which\nimpacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend\nto be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as\nadditional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust\nand continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected\nby current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in\nunfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the\npricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic policies,\nincentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. We will continue to adjust\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and\nefficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to\nour competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not\nbecome a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third\nmonth of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will\nalso have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle\nreliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other\nautomotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and agreements\nwith us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet\ncustomer demands.

Revenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other\nfeatures and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance,\ninternet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales\nupon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control\ntransfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected\nover the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for\nexpected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as\naccess to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control\ntransfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services\nto the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is\nearlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the\nexpected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered\nto the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate\nstandalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and\nother information that may be available. Inventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and\nenergy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or\nobsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of\nour future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate\nsale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the\ninventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established\nand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs\nmay be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. 35\n3/21/25, 5:37 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n39/116\n",

    "page_content": "These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs\nof future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause\nmaterial changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated\nwith our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to\nrepair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next\n12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we\nrecord receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is\nrecorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive\nbusiness, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Stock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees\nand for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the\nstock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the\ngrant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such\nas the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant\njudgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The\nresulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance\nachievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone\nbecomes probable. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation\nof our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S.",
